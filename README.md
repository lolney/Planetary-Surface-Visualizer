Planetary-Surface-Visualizer
============================

This WebGL application simulates the motion of the sun over the course of the year, complete with a 3D graphical representation of the view from the surface. You can also adjust parameters like the axial tilt or the planetary radius to see how the yearly cycle would look on other planets.

TODO (rough priority order):

Eye vector for zooming in/out<br>
Proper time zone handling (/longitude)<br>
Add presentable UI <br>
Better ground plane <br>
Support for different day/year lengths<br>
Add more planetary parameters (eg, eccentricity)<br>
Equation of time included in time calculations<br>
Database of planets<br>
Random terrain generation<br>

More visualization options: <br>
Planet map with currently illuminated area <br>
Sundial (along with proper lighting) <br>
