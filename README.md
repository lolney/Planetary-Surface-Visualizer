Planetary-Surface-Visualizer
============================

This WebGL application simulates the motion of the sun over the course of the year, complete with a 3D graphical representation of the view from the surface. You can also adjust parameters like the axial tilt or the planetary radius to see how the yearly cycle would look on other planets.
